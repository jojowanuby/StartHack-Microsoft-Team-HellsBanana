# 1-Discover and Planning Phase (Sprint1)
## In a first phase, we identify our problem space for the case, potential user groups and ideated around first solutions
### We started with a brainstorming session to better understand the case.
We created several questions that we wanted to find answers for and aimed to define a problem space for which we are trying to create a solution. Through the questions and answers we were able to identify potential use cases that we could aim for to find solutions.

###### We used Miro to work collaboratively on the case.

What if... a personal assistant can help you understand your illness better?

### Team role definitions work and time planning
We Talked about our core competencies and discussed how we would like to work on this Project together. We decided to go for an agile approach and discuss our general approach regularly and then meet up in a shorter sequence to discuss progress, problems, and questions.
