# Mivy Your Personal health assistant
**Myvi is a personal health bot ðŸ¤– designed to help you understand anything related to your personal health.**

## Problem space

Regarding personal health, patients normally use the internet particularly as an information source or if they have unanswered questions after for example a doctors appointment. This information is mostly useful, but too general and not aligned to the individual needs of the patients. Moreover, a lot of this information is not certified in anyway. A conclusion consequent is that information alone is not enough. There is a need for a deeper dialogue. 

## What if...

...we could bring the subject of personal health closer to the patient even after a doctors appointment. What if a patient has the possibility to extend a dialogue around their health? A dialogue that does not necessarily need to be with a real human being, but with an artificial intelligence? Of course, we are aware of the fact that with this, we will ignite technical boundaries and arise some ethical questions. However, we still see a lot of potential in learning more about the needs and living environment of patients through such a solution which will enable an extended dialogue for patients around their personal health.

## Meet Myvi

Mivy is a personal health assistant, designed to help patients understand  their personal health better. Myvi works like a chatbot that has access to certified information and experiences around anything health related and communicates through a mobile dialogue with the patient. Myvi is a concept for an app that works similar to, e.g. a Whatsapp group chat and fits the dialogue to the language and personal needs of the user.

### Features:
**Here are some potential things Myvi could do:**
1. Explain health-related documents with easy-understanable terms
2. Find materials and resources related to health topics
3. Tailor answers to your personal needs and questions
4. Ability to translate medical papers into many languages
5. All personal data is 100% anonymised and secure.

### Our prototypes

Our first prototype is showcasing our vision of how Myvi could look like and how patients could interact with it. It's a click-dummy designed in Figma.

Our second prototype is a working prototype developed with the two Azure Services (QnA and Webap robot). We trained Myvi on the topic of Breast Cancer with resources provided by the challenge host in the GitHub as well as important questions and Information from leading breast cancer organisations. A potential patient can already have a very simple conversation with Myvi around this topic.
